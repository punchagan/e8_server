e8_server

A simple PHP+HTML site we wrote for a fun cricket tournament in our hostel. It
was written mostly by @avudem and me.

Source code for my first PHP app salvaged from an old HDD.  The project didn't
have any version control.  And yes,
we didn't have any database backups, either.

This would probably serve as a good example for how not to write apps in PHP.

To run this site, use `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000`.
